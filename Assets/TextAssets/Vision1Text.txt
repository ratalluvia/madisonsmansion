A sharp and sudden pain flashes across the field of vision and your eyesight quickly blurs. As your vision comes into focus again, you are no longer looking out your own eyes, but those of your grandmother many years ago. You see your piano, and you see your hands gracefully pressing the keys. You hear the end of a familiar song, one that you think you will teach your granddaughter one day, once she's had time to grow large enough to press down the keys.

As you finish the song, you hear a soft click, and then your vision fades again, and you wake back up, Madison again.
